Rolling Stock RFID Manager (RSRM)
This micro-service web component processes RFID messages and attempts to find the road name and number from the inventory of rolling stock. It is dependent on two other components:

RIDS, which provides services to access the MongoDB collection of rolling stock documents containing a RFID associated to a road name and number
ISIS, which subscribes to RFID IoT messages and pushes those messages to the manager
