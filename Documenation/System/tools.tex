\chapter{Software Development Environment}

\section{Visual Studio Code}
A development environment, also known as an \ac{IDE}, is a software tool or a set of tools that provides a comprehensive environment for developers to create, edit, test, and debug software applications. It encompasses various components, features, and functionalities that aid in the software development process.\vspace{5mm} \\
A development environment typically includes the following key elements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Code Editor: A code editor is the central component of a development environment. It provides a text editor with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, code navigation, and formatting. It allows developers to write and modify code efficiently.
  \item Compiler/Interpreter: A development environment often includes a compiler or interpreter specific to the programming language being used. It translates the written code into executable or interpretable form.
  \item Build Tools: Build tools automate the process of compiling, linking, and packaging software applications. They help in managing dependencies, generating binaries, and performing other build-related tasks.
  \item Debugging Tools: Debugging tools enable developers to identify and fix issues in their code. They provide features like breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and tracking program execution flow.
  \item Version Control Integration: Many development environments integrate with version control systems like Git, allowing developers to manage and track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and handle branching and merging.
  \item Project Management: Development environments often offer project management features to organize and manage multiple files and resources within a project. They may include features like project templates, file navigation, and project-specific settings.
  \item Testing Framework Integration: Some development environments integrate with testing frameworks, making it easier to write and run unit tests, perform automated testing, and generate test reports.
  \item Documentation Support: Development environments may provide features to assist in documenting code, such as auto-generating documentation, code commenting support, and integration with documentation generation tools.
  \item Integration with External Tools and Libraries: A good development environment allows seamless integration with external tools, libraries, and frameworks specific to the chosen programming language or platform. This makes it easier to utilize third-party libraries and leverage existing ecosystem resources.
  \item Customization and Extension: Development environments often offer extensibility through plugins, extensions, or a package management system. This allows developers to enhance the functionality of the environment by adding new features or integrating with additional tools.
\end{itemize}

\section{Docker}
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that encapsulate an application and all its dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and other runtime components. Docker allows the user to package an application into a container image, which can then be run consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.\vspace{5mm} \\
Docker provides the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Docker containers are portable and can run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure. This eliminates the "works on my machine" problem and ensures consistent behavior across different environments.
  \item Containers provide a high level of isolation, ensuring that applications and their dependencies are encapsulated and do not interfere with each other. This isolation improves security, as well as prevents conflicts between different software components.
  \item Docker containers are lightweight and share the host system's operating system kernel. This means they require fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs). Multiple containers can run on the same host without significant performance overhead.
  \item Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple instances of containers across different hosts or a cluster of machines. This enables efficient utilization of resources and helps handle increased workload demands.
  \item Docker allows versioning of container images, making it easier to track changes and roll back to a previous version if needed. This simplifies the deployment and update process, reducing the risk of application downtime.
  \item Docker has a large and active community, resulting in a vast ecosystem of pre-built container images available from Docker Hub and other registries. These images can be easily pulled and used as a base for building and deploying applications, saving development time.
